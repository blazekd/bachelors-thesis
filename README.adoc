## Multithreaded Timsort

This is my bachelor's thesis. Please note that the text part is written in Czech. https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/109377?locale-attribute=en[Link to school site]

The aim of this thesis is to explore the sequential optimizations of the Timsort algorithm and its parallelization using OpenMP. Newly developed algorithms are tested and compared with the base version of Timsort and other selected sorting algorithms. This testing is performed on the school server STAR, designed for objective testing of parallel algorithms. All implementations are in the C++ language.
